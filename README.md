# ninjaTool
Addon for FFXI / AshitaXI v4 that includes the following:
 - Discrete / graphically adjustable shadow counter.
 - Display to show tool count & spell recast.
 
![ninjaTool: Spell Window](images/spellWindow.png "Spell Window")

**Note:** This is the HorizonXI approved version of the NinjaCast addon (https://github.com/m4thmatic/ninjaCast).
The primary change is that the single macro wheel casting/tracking functionality has been removed.

You can achieve an almost identical behavior by putting the following commands inside a single macro.
<br>`/ma "Hyoton: Ni" <t>`
<br>`/ma "Katon: Ni" <t>`
<br>`/ma "Suiton: Ni" <t>`
<br>`/ma "Raiton: Ni" <t>`
<br>`/ma "Doton: Ni" <t>`
<br>`/ma "Huton: Ni" <t>`

## Commands:
`/ninjaTool, /nintool, /nt` *Open the configuration menu.*
